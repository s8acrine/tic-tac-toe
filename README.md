# ❌ ⭕️ Tic Tac Toe

This is a web game for two players on one device, taking turns. You will have to use component state to keep track of whose turn it is and which squares have been marked by each player. This project will challenge your knowledge of React but should also be an exercise in creating good user experiences.

When creating a project it is important to think about organization of your code. It is best practice to separate and compartmentalize all the actions in your code. The square UI will be in its own component. App.js controls of all the data in state, renders the other components, and performs the game logic.

### 📚 User Stories

- ✅ As a user, I can see a three by three grid game board on the page.

  - Iterate squares to display square component for each element
  - Use styling to set up grid
  - setup a div for all boxes to be able to use flexbox
  - assign a class to the div: **gameboard**
  - use **flex-wrap: wrap** to wrap the game board
  - set div width to 3x box width + border width + ~20 pixels of 'wiggle room'
  - set font-size to 150 px and text-align to center

- As a user, I can click on a square to mark it.

  - need a clickHandle function
    - let updatedBoard be set to the current board state using spread operator
    - update clicked index using bracket notation
    - update game state with updatedBoard
  - need an onClick to call that function, pass in index as a prop to the Square component

- As a user, my partner can click on a square after me and see their mark.
- As a user, I can't click on a square that has already been marked.
- As a user, when either my partner or I win the game (three squares in a row: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) I can see a notice telling me which player won.
- As a user, I can't continue playing the game after the game has been won.
- As a user, if there are no more squares available, I can see a notice telling me that the game has ended.
- As a user, I can click on a restart button that will clear the game board.

### 🏔 Stretch Goals

- As a user, I can see a notification that informs me whether it is currently my partner or my turn.
- As a user, I can choose my marker from a predetermined list (X, O, a color, an emoji, etc...).

### 👩‍💻 Developer Stretch Goals

- As a developer, I have a well commented application.
- As a developer, I have well written README file with instructions on how to access my repository.
- As a developer, my variables are all named semantically.
- As a developer, I have refactored and efficient code.
- As a developer, I have my application [deployed as a live website](https://render.com/docs/deploy-create-react-app).
